# Atrix v1.0
Atrix is an open source project based around iPhone/iPad/iPod 30pin to serial adapter or breakout hardware.

Two subprojects exsist;

Atrix breakout - just gives you a small piece of hardware that just breaks out USB for sync and serial for uses such as on device kernel debugging. This is more of a BYOB (bring your own board) project as you'll need to provide your own serial converter such as an FTDI Basic, or the similar. 

Atrix adapter - gives you everything you need in one package, FTDI and USB all on one board for convenience.
